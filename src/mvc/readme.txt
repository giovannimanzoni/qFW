https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-cutting_concern

In aspect-oriented software development, cross-cutting concerns are aspects of a program that affect other concerns.
These concerns often cannot be cleanly decomposed from the rest of the system in both the design and implementation,
and can result in either scattering (code duplication), tangling (significant dependencies between systems), or both.


Examples of concerns that tend to be cross-cutting include:

    Synchronization
    Real-time constraints
    Error detection and correction
    Product features
    Memory management
    Data validation
    Persistence
    Transaction processing
    Internationalization and localization which includes Language localisation
    Information security
    Caching
    Logging
    Monitoring
    Business rules
    Code mobility
    Domain-specific optimizations
