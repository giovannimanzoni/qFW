MODELS
==================

It is important to understand that models are not limited to database work. Models can connect to any
number of third-party data services, and provide a simple interface for use in our controllers. We just happen to
be focusing our models into the ORM paradigm.
We could just as easily need to build a model that connects to Flickr to download photos, or a model that
allows us to upload/download files from a cloud computing network like Amazon S3. Models are meant to
contain any and every resource not presented directly in a view, or used by a controller to connect views and
models together.

Model is the worker, perform operation.
